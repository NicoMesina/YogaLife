            <h3><br>Yoga benefits</br> 
               <br> <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"> </i></h3> </br>
    <p>
       <ul><br><li><b>Better flexibility</b></li></br></ul>
Your body goes through a lot of stress daily and the best way to recover is finding peace within you to start. Yoga is a great way to control breathing, and most importantly find peace within you by connecting all your body and mind together. All types of stretching will not only give you a better flexibility but also make you feel way more energetic and healthier overall. 
    
<ul><br><li><b>Muscle strength</b></li></br></ul>
The amazing thing about yoga is how it can build so much strength in your body by just doing body weight exercising including balancing and much more.
    
<ul><br><li><b>Better respiration</b></li></br></ul>
Yoga helps you to connect with your inner self. This is because it involves a lot of breathing patterns that helps your lungs to absorb more oxygen which leads to more vitality.

<ul><br><li><b>Weight controlling</b></li></br></ul>
The effects of Yoga on your weight and metabolism are long lasting. Weight reduction through Yoga gives you a perfect and balanced approach towards weight reduction.

<ul><br><li><b>Better posture</b></li></br></ul>
Yoga helps you to maintain a good posture. It ensures that you maintain an erect spine. Fatigue and sedentary work can lead to a lot of problems which can impact you in the long run. Doing yoga will correct your posture and how you walk.

<ul><br><li><b>Better joint health</b></li></br></ul>
Yoga helps to avoid arthritis or any kind of bone related disability. Joint cartilage in a human body is like a sponge that absorbs nutrients. Certain areas of cartilage wear out and this is why it is crucial to protect its health and regeneration properties at the right time. Yoga helps to keep your cartilage health intact.

<ul><br><li><b>Blood flow and heart rate</b></li></br></ul>
Yoga helps to maintain good blood flow and improves blood circulation as well. It enhances venous blood flow from internal organs to other areas in the body. Swelling in legs and other parts of the body is reduced when you practice even the simplest of yoga techniques. Blood clots can lead to blocking of arteries and heart attacks. Yoga is known to maintain your heart rate at a healthy speed.

<ul><br><li><b>Other Benefits of Yoga</b></li></br></ul>
Apart from the physical benefits, one of the best health benefits of Yoga is the way it helps you to manage stress. Stress can lead to back or neck pain, cause sleeping disorders, headaches and various other problems. Yoga helps to mitigate these mind related problems. It gives you a better perspective and helps you tackle challenges in life with a fresh mind. In todayâ€™s fast paced lives, mental or emotional health can never be taken for granted. Yoga lets you strike that perfect balance between your mental and physical health. Regular practice of yoga gives mental clarity and helps you to make better decisions. Self-awareness and calmness that yoga asanas contribute to your lifestyle have an immense impact on your overall health.
