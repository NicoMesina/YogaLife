                            Your body goes through a lot of stress daily and the best way to recover is finding peace
                            within you to start. Yoga is a great way to control breathing, and most importantly find
                            peace within you by connecting all your body and mind together. All types of stretching will
                            not only give you a better flexibility but also make you feel way more energetic and
                            healthier overall.

                            Yoga as exercise is a physical activity consisting mainly of postures, often connected by
                            flowing sequences, sometimes accompanied by breathing exercises, and frequently ending with
                            relaxation lying down or meditation.
                            Practicing yoga can help with body awareness, flexibility, strength, mobility, and balance.
                            It also requires you to shift into a more relaxed state, which can help decrease stress,
                            increase focus, and promote a stronger connection with yourself. The amazing part of Yoga is
                            that you can do it anywhere where you have just enough space. Close your eyes, breath and
                            relax.

                            </mark>
                            Yoga helps you to connect with your inner self. This is because it involves a lot of
                            breathing patterns that helps your lungs to absorb more oxygen which leads to more vitality.

                            The effects of Yoga on your weight and metabolism are long lasting. Weight reduction through
                            Yoga gives you a perfect and balanced approach towards weight reduction.

                            Yoga helps you to maintain a good posture. It ensures that you maintain an erect spine.
                            Fatigue and sedentary work can lead to a lot of problems which can impact you in the long
                            run. Doing yoga will correct your posture and how you walk.

                            Yoga helps to avoid arthritis or any kind of bone related disability. Joint cartilage in a
                            human body is like a sponge that absorbs nutrients. Certain areas of cartilage wear out and
                            this is why it is crucial to protect its health and regeneration properties at the right
                            time. Yoga helps to keep your cartilage health intact.

                            Yoga helps to maintain good blood flow and improves blood circulation as well. It enhances
                            venous blood flow from internal organs to other areas in the body. Swelling in legs and
                            other parts of the body is reduced when you practice even the simplest of yoga techniques.
                            Blood clots can lead to blocking of arteries and heart attacks. Yoga is known to maintain
                            your heart rate at a healthy speed.

                            Apart from the physical benefits, one of the best health benefits of Yoga is the way it
                            helps you to manage stress. Stress can lead to back or neck pain, cause sleeping disorders,
                            headaches and various other problems. Yoga helps to mitigate these mind related problems. It
                            gives you a better perspective and helps you tackle challenges in life with a fresh mind. In
                            today’s fast paced lives, mental or emotional health can never be taken for granted. Yoga
                            lets you strike that perfect balance between your mental and physical health. Regular
                            practice of yoga gives mental clarity and helps you to make better decisions. Self-awareness
                            and calmness that yoga asanas contribute to your lifestyle have an immense impact on your
                            overall health.
