**Purpose**

I have created this website with the intention of sending a message to our viewers about Yoga and the benefits of Yoga. In my opinion this is much more then Yoga, this is all about the internal life within you and I tried my best to give a clear idea of the importance of having that time of the day just for you. Breathing, stretching, and giving your body that internal peace for a better you. Let’s be honest, our daily lifes are busy and stressful even when we don’t think it is. I also have involved few techniques that can be done at home. The main purpose was also to make it simple and straight forward including:

- Benefits of Yoga
- When and where are the classes
- The times
- And join us button

**Home Page:** I have really spent time in making sure that the home page is simple and straight to the point by making sure I have the right image in place with a nice welcome header! I also made sure that the “YogaLife” header on the top left side of the page is clickable and it brings the viewer back to the home page no matter what. I have also made sure that when scrolling down the viewer can see the benefits of Yoga answering some of the most common questions asked about Yoga. Right below the benefits I have also introduced our viewer few techniques they can easily perform at home and followed by that we have the schedule and “JOIN US” button that brings the viewers straight to my email address. There are also social media icons that are clickable. I have also made sure to use that specific color all throughout the home page as it gives the first impression of yoga and of something positive, I could not use a dark color on such topic as yoga, yoga brings peace and it requires a positive peaceful color.

**Gallery:** I did not want to complicate the gallery page as I believe the home page is the most important which provides all the necessary information. Gallery was more for the viewers to see some of the postures made and also the location of the classes which is in the park. I also believe this yoga classes brings people closer; this are group classes which are great for people to get to know each other and have great time and that’s what we see in those photos.

**Sign up:** This sign-up page is a very important part of the website as the viewer can easily sign up and join us. Also, a reply will be sent back to the viewer with the rest of the information, payments and time as a confirmation. The structure and purpose of this page is to be simple and effective. I have also made a JOINUS button for a simple way for anyone to get in touch via email and on the other side I have made a signup page for anyone interested in scheduling the day they might consider coming for the yoga class.

**Structure**

I have made this site simple and straight to the point with simple explanation and times for the Yoga classes. The navigation menu is easy to use. All viewers will be able to navigate easily though the website and find the information. The main purpose of the structure on this site was to make it simple and effective for the viewers to see the benefits of yoga and the times to join us.

HTML and CSS was used to make the Website. The layouts and images are the correct sizing to stand out and make it simple for the viewers.

All pages are responsive and the layouts will change depending on screen size. I also made sure that the website can be viewed clearly on mobile devices.

**Design**

**Color** 

The three main colors used are light pink, white and light blue on the website as I believe this are positive colors which match up great with yoga. I also believe it’s very catchy on the eyes and it gives an easy positive view of the website. This website is for yoga lovers and i chose positive opening colors choices like light pink, white, and light blue which are associated with health, wellness and relaxation.

**Look & feel**

The main body font for the home page is “Laila” as I believe its associated with yoga and it transmits trough the website a nice design that standouts and it wont be boring for the viewer while reading.

The primary colors:

![RGB(255, 255, 128)!](/assets/images/pic1.png "RGB(255, 255, 128)")
![(#fff)!](/assets/images/pic2.png "(#fff)")

**Heading**

The header has a font-family of **tiro bangla** as I believe it’s a strong bolded dark color that stands out. I have also made sure the header is clickable and it will bring you back to the home page no matter what. I have used the _font-size 35px_ as it stands out on all pages.
